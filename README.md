This is a web based application that I built to help keep track of my monthly income and spending as a means to increase my knowledge of fullstack development.

This project uses the MERN stack, and I'm honestly surprised at how much I liked using react. Everyone complains about javascript, and maybe I just haven't had enough exposure to it, but I really liked working with it. 

Once you add a transaction, it sends a post request to my mongo cloud database, which is then accessed using a get request and is written to the front end. I handled all of the HTTP requests with nodejs (WHOOO I BUILT AN API).

I look forward to developing more fullstack projects; I see why so many people want to get into this field.
